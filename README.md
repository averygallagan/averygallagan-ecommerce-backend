Week 13 E-Commerce Back End

This week we were tasked with creating an ecommerce backend. A user must run npm i to install the dependencies, login to postgres, run the schema.sql, run npm run seed, and npm start to get the application going. Once it is up, the user can navigate routes in insomnia to get all categories, products, or tags. They can also get a specific item by its id. A user can post new items, update existing items, or delete items.
